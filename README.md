## INTRODUCTION
Carbon monoxide (CO) pollutants that are too high are a problem for both the environment and people. CO
comes mostly from incomplete car combustion and industrial processes. It is a major cause of air pollution,
which lowers the quality of the air and speeds up climate change. Both the transportation industry and
industrial facilities need to be fixed right away because they are major sources of CO emissions. Society: Being
exposed to CO can cause serious health problems like headaches and sickness, and it could even be
life-threatening. This shows how important it is to regulate and keep an eye on factory emissions. People don't
know enough about the problem, which makes it even more important to teach and tell people about how CO
emissions from vehicles and factories affect the environment and health. To really deal with the problems that
CO emissions cause, we need a plan that looks at both the environmental and social aspects of the problem.
This plan should put air quality, preventing climate change, human health, and public awareness at the top of
its list, and it should focus on keeping an eye on and controlling CO emissions from factories
